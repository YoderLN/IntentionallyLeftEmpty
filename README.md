# First Repository
Intelligible Nonsense

I'm a third year student pursuing a BAS at Austin Community College, and this is my first attempt at using Github.
My interests include Magic: The Gathering, Power/Symphonic Metal, and Strategy/RPG Video Games.


Now a fourth year student nearly finished with my BAS degree, looking to join the workforce soon.
Regular commits from here forward, I promise.
